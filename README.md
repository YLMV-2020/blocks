## Circuit components

These components are used:

  1. A simple _Tetris_ experience. The user must easily recognize the game and spent some time with it.
  2. Full separation between the core gameplay implementation and the graphic, input, or font libraries that could be used by the game.
  3. No _global_ variables in the core game implementation.
  4. Good code standards.
